# Extended-linear-search

This algorithm uses `extended linear self-equivalences` to search for new APN functions. 


## Usage
This program takes one required inputs, a file containing `F, L1, A, cycles`. `F` is a vectorial Boolean function and `L_1` and `A` are from the self equivalence $L_1\circ F \circ L_2 + A = F$ and `cycles` are the cycles generated by applying `L_2` to itself. 

`F, L1`  and `A` are all in truth table form without dimension on top, meaning that they contain all the entries of the truth table as integer representation. And the cycles are in the same format, with each cylce separated by `;`

For example:
```
0 17 60 37 20 46 0 50 6 53 8 51 40 48 14 30 0 10 48 50 2 35 26 51 61 21 63 31 5 6 47 36 48 27 3 32 5 5 30 22 15 6 14 15 0 34 41 3 26 42 37 29 57 34 46 61 30 12 19 9 7 62 34 19

```

In /results there are the result of running EL equivalence algorithm of all known APN functions in dimension 6, 8 and 10 up to CCZ equivalence. In results/all_non-zero there are all the results where A is non-zero. All the cycles of these have been precomputed and is available in results/cycles_non-zero.csv.

```
Usage: 
./EXTENDED-LINEAR-APN-SEARCH [PATH] [OPTIONS]

Arguments:
  [PATH]  File containing F, L1, A, cycles.

Options:
  --gen_con  Generates contradictions and prints it to standard output.
  --con      Runs with precomputed contradictions from the file given

If no options are given, the program will first generate the contradictions and then run the search.
```
